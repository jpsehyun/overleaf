\section{Background of the Study}
\label{sec:overview}

History is normally taught with traditional methods such as lectures and discussions. As it requires high levels of understanding, the youth often avoids history. There are other methods that lecturers utilize in teaching history, such as creative means like audio-visual presentations, software, and interactive means. Video games provide an excellent example of interactive and affective learning. Not only is it popular among the new generation, but it grants freedom to choose however they may play the game and achieve different results.
 
\subsection{Students' Hardship in Classes}
There are multiple factors which makes a student lose their interest and participation in a typical classroom settings. Some of the factors include easy or difficult materials, lack of interest in a subject, and a lecture-based environment \cite{medium:mosley}. Out of all the problems which causes the students to disconnect from the act of learning, test-driven classroom culture was one of the biggest factor which significantly impacts students' educational experience \cite{mora}. The studentsâ€™ negative view of the classroom primarily focused on multiple standardized test they needed to prepare, and how classes were centered around these tests rather than students.

The same study by \cite{mora} showed how students were less bored and engaged when the classes were integrated with more interactive and hands-on activities such as poster-making and science experiments, rather than typical lecture based classroom set ups. This behavior of the students opens up to the possibility of integrating augmented reality simulation based learning material to enhance the involvement of the students to the class and further enhance their performances by creating a student-centered environment.


\subsection{Utilization of Augmented Reality with Affective Learning}

\section{Research Objectives}
The project aims to develop an augmented reality simulation application that includes affective learning to enhance the user's understanding of historical events, focusing on the Bataan Death March. The researchers aims to investigate and address the factors causing student's difficulties in history classes and develop strategies to enhance student's learning experience.

The specific objective of this project is directed into answering these following questions
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can augmented reality technology be utilized to create an immersive environment for the users?
    \item How can the integration of augmented reality simulations aid in teaching history through the use of affective learning?
    \item How do students assess the effectiveness of augmented reality simulations in improving their comprehension and engagement with historical events? 
\end{enumerate}

The expected outcome of this project is
