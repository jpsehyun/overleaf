\chapter{Related Works}
\label{sec:relatedworks}

This chapter provides a synthesis of past research, existing algorithms, and or state-of-the-art software that are related/similar to the thesis. It should not present detailed summaries of each related work, but rather present a cohesive comparison of different aspects of their work. At the end of each section and this chapter, it should be clear what research challenges and opportunities will be focused on for the proposal.

The sections can be about approaches, application areas, and categories of solutions that give readers an deep understanding of the current state of the field. 

Observe a consistent format when presenting each of the reviewed works. This must be selected in consultation with the prospective adviser.

\textcolor{red}{DO NOT FORGET to cite your references.} Related works can be discussed multiple times in different sections of this chapter, depending on what is being discussed or compared.

1. Identify the keywords with respect to your research
      One keyword = One document section
                Examples: 2.1 Story Generation Systems
			 2.2 Knowledge Representation

2.  Find references using these keywords

3.  For each of the references that you find,
        Check: Is it relevant to your research?
        Use their references to find more relevant works.

4. Identify a set of criteria for comparison.
       It will serve as a guide to help you focus on what to look for

5. Write a summary focusing on -
       What: A short description of the work
